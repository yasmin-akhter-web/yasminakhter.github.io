        <p>I specialize in Global Anglophone literature and culture from the 19th century to today. I place British Romantic and Victorian literature in conversation with literatures from the Global South (especially the Caribbean, South Asia, and East Asia) as well as North America, with a focus on the histories of imperialism; anti-colonialism, decoloniality, and postcolonialism; and a literary theme and political concept called decadence. I am the Founder of the Global Decadence Lab at the Decadence Research Centre in Goldsmiths, University of London, where I have been a Visiting Research Fellow since 2023. My work has received awards and honors from the British Association for Decadence Studies (BADS) and the Northeast Victorian Studies Associaton (NVSA).</p>
        <p>I have secondary interests in the archive, gender and sexuality studies, and the digital humanities, alongside Black Studies, Asian North American and Asian Diaspora Studies, Indigenous Studies, and Latin American studies. I also concentrated on issues about translation and untranslatibility at the Harvard Institute for World Literature. Alongside English and Cantonese, I continue to deepen my fluency in Mandarin and French (my third and fourth languages). A full CV is available upon request.</p>

<h3>Book Project</h3>
    <p>My first book project is about decadence in the Anglophone and multilingual literatures of the long ninteenth and twentieth centuries. It has two intertwined aims. The first is to unearth a new literary history about decadent writing, anchored around two key events in the long nineteenth century: the Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) and the British colonization of Hong Kong (1842-1997). The second is to examine how enslaved and colonized writers and their descendants in this period created their own versions of artistic and literary decadence within and against the era's imperialist oppressions, while also negotiating with the complex relationship that decadence has typically had to conservatism. The project coins the term "Duvalian decadence" to describe their work, after nineteenth-century French decadent poet Charles Baudelaire's Haitian lover, Jeanne Duval.</p>
